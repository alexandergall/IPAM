### Validate ipam.xml aginst the schema.  It appears that only James Clark
### is able to write a working RelaxNG vlaidator :(  The validator based on
### libxml2 is buggy, which makes XML::LibXML::RelaxNG unusable as well.
### For now, we perform validation outside of the IPAM Perl module using
### jing.

### Show the differences of all currently checked-out files which have
### been modified since the last successful validation.

### Generate zone file snippets and rebuild the zones.  The snippets
### are written to a local directory and compared to the d.ipam files
### currently installed in the proper zone directories.  The newly
### generated files are installed only if they differ from the old ones
### to avoid building the zone unnecessarily.
